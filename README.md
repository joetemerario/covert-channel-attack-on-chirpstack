# Covert Channel Attack on ChirpStack

## An example project in Go for a Covert Channel Attack to a LoRaWAN network with a ChirpStack Network Server

This project is a part of my Master thesis in Cybersecurity, it is an implementation of a Covert Channel Attack on a LoRaWAN network. I used a ChirpStack open source Network Server from Brocaar,
in particular the Dockerized version available in [ChirpStack Docker](https://github.com/chirpstack/chirpstack-docker?tab=readme-ov-file) and the [ChirpStack Simulator](https://github.com/brocaar/chirpstack-simulator)
project also from Brocaar to create the End Devices and the Gateway to test the attack.

### Instructions
My project runs on a Debian server and I will list the commands I used to install and setup everything I needed.
